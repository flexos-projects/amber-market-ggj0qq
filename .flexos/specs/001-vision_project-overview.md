# Project Overview

## Vision

A vibrant marketplace for unique handmade treasures, crafted with passion.

## Problem

Artisans often struggle to find a simple, affordable, and community-focused platform to sell their unique handmade crafts without getting lost in an ocean of mass-produced goods. Buyers, on the other hand, desire a curated experience to easily discover authentic, handcrafted items and support independent creators, but frequently find larger marketplaces overwhelming or lacking genuine artisanal focus.

## Solution

CraftMart offers a streamlined, intuitive platform designed specifically for handmade goods. It empowers artisans with easy-to-use listing tools and a dedicated seller dashboard, while providing buyers with a curated browsing experience, secure checkout, and reliable order tracking, fostering a thriving community around authentic craftsmanship.

## Target User

Independent artisans, hobbyists, and small-batch creators specializing in handmade goods like jewelry, pottery, textiles, digital art prints, and personalized gifts. Buyers are individuals who appreciate unique, high-quality, and personalized items, consciously seeking to support small businesses and find alternatives to commercial products.
