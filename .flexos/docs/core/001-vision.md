## 1. Vision Statement

Our vision is to create the world's most trusted and beloved community for handmade goods, where every unique creation finds a cherished home and every artisan can build a sustainable, passion-driven business.

## 2. Mission Statement

CraftMart's mission is to empower independent artisans by providing a simple, beautiful, and affordable platform to showcase their craft. We connect conscious buyers with authentic, high-quality handmade treasures, fostering a vibrant community built on creativity, transparency, and a shared love for the unique.

## 3. Core Strategy

Our strategy is centered on building a strong, focused community before scaling. We will differentiate from oversized marketplaces by championing authenticity and simplicity.

1.  **MVP First:** Launch with the essential P0 features outlined in the [Features Document](./002-features.md). This includes user authentication, product listing, browsing/searching, and a secure checkout. This allows us to get to market quickly and start learning from real users.
2.  **Artisan-Centric Onboarding:** Actively recruit a curated group of initial artisans. Provide them with white-glove support to ensure their success, which will in turn attract buyers. Our success is their success.
3.  **Transparent & Simple Fees:** Implement a clear, low-cost fee structure that is easy for artisans to understand and is more competitive than platforms like Etsy. This will be a key part of our value proposition.
4.  **Community-Led Growth:** Foster community through featured artisan stories on our blog and social media, and by encouraging meaningful interactions through the review system. We will build a brand that stands for quality and authenticity.
5.  **Data-Informed Iteration:** Post-launch, we will prioritize P1 features like the Review System and Wishlists based on user feedback and data analysis of key success metrics.

## 4. Target User Personas

### Persona 1: The Artisan

*   **Name:** Chloe, The Part-Time Potter
*   **Demographics:** 32 years old, lives in a mid-sized city, works a day job in graphic design.
*   **Goals:** Wants to turn her passion for pottery into a meaningful side income. She wants to share her work with people who appreciate it without the stress of managing a personal website or navigating complex marketplace rules.
*   **Frustrations:** Feels lost on large platforms dominated by resellers and mass-produced items. Finds their fee structures confusing and their listing tools cumbersome. She worries her unique work isn't seen by the right audience.
*   **How CraftMart Helps:** CraftMart offers a simple, dedicated platform for handmade goods only. The `product-listing-management` feature is intuitive, and the `seller-dashboard-page` gives her clear insights into her sales without overwhelming her with data.

### Persona 2: The Buyer

*   **Name:** Mark, The Thoughtful Gift-Giver
*   **Demographics:** 45 years old, marketing manager, values quality and story over price.
*   **Goals:** To find a unique, high-quality, handcrafted gift for his wife's birthday. He wants to feel good about his purchase by supporting a small creator directly.
*   **Frustrations:** Overwhelmed by the sheer volume and questionable authenticity of items on Amazon and Etsy. He finds it hard to sift through pages of irrelevant results to find genuine handcrafted items.
*   **How CraftMart Helps:** The `browse-search-filter` feature on the `/shop` page allows Mark to easily navigate to the 'Pottery' category and filter by price. He can read about the artisan on the `product-detail-page`, building a connection to the product and creator before making a purchase through our `secure-cart-checkout` flow.
